# MapleStory Classic custom-server laboratory

This directory contains the first protocol-compatible server tooling for the
Taiwan/Hong Kong MapleStory Classic Unity client. It is deliberately isolated
from the Albion Phoenix application.

## Confirmed client endpoints

The serialized `GameConfig` and a post-bootstrap packet capture establish:

- login hostname: `tw-login.maplestoryclassic.games.gamania.com`
- login TCP port: `10282`
- observed login address: `35.73.142.21:10282`
- legacy HTTP probe/handoff: `54.238.121.146:58880`
- successful reference login: `43.142.194.25:10282` (`tcp.stream 83`)
- successful reference world: `43.142.194.150:8587` (`tcp.stream 92`)

The world connection exchanged 77 client bytes and 218 server bytes before it
closed. Login uses a 33-byte cleartext greeting followed by encrypted frames
whose four-byte headers encode payload length as the XOR of two little-endian
16-bit words. The observed greeting identifies protocol version `300`,
subversion `300`, and locale `4`.

## Commands

Run commands from this directory:

```sh
python -m maple_server stub \
  --listen-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --listen-port 10282 \
  --transcript-dir captures
```

Proxy the official login endpoint while recording both directions:

```sh
export MAPLE_PROXY_USER='...'
export MAPLE_PROXY_PASSWORD='...'
python -m maple_server capture-proxy \
  --listen-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --listen-port 10282 \
  --upstream-host tw-login.maplestoryclassic.games.gamania.com \
  --upstream-port 10282 \
  --http-proxy-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --http-proxy-port 3128 \
  --transcript-dir captures
```

Replay a captured session:

```sh
python -m maple_server replay \
  --listen-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --listen-port 10282 \
  --transcript captures/session.jsonl \
  --transcript-dir captures/replay-observed
```

PCAP streams can be consumed directly. The loader uses `tshark` without a
shell, reassembles TCP sequence space, identifies the server from the Maple
handshake, and normalizes segment data to one event per encrypted frame:

```sh
python -m maple_server replay \
  --listen-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --listen-port 10282 \
  --no-strict \
  --pcap /path/to/reference.pcapng \
  --tcp-stream 83
```

Replay is strict by default: client bytes must match the recorded session.
This is useful for identifying which bytes are stable framing and which are
per-session authentication or cryptographic material. `--no-strict` is
available for exploratory runs. `--transcript-dir` records what the new client
actually sent as well as the replayed server bytes.

Exploratory login work also supports `--server-frame-patch`, reactive
`--reply-on-client-opcode`, ordered `--send-after-transcript` frames, a uniform
`--post-transcript-frame-delay-seconds`, and repeated
`--post-transcript-gap-delay-seconds` values. Gap-specific delays apply to the
combined queued-reactive-reply and appended-frame sequence; missing values
fall back to the uniform delay.

Plaintext frames may also be sourced privately at runtime with
`--send-after-transcript-from-pcap`,
`--server-frame-patch-from-pcap`, or
`--reply-on-client-opcode-from-pcap`. A repeated reactive opcode creates an
ordered response sequence. `--client-opcode-reply-delays` supplies one delay
per response, which is required for the observed 2.5-second gap between the
two server opcode-`402` channel-transition packets.
`--rewrite-channel-transition-world` binds the stage-1 world id to the live
client opcode-`4` selection instead of replaying the captured world verbatim.

Validate a login capture and fold it into typed game state without printing
account or character identifiers:

```sh
python -m maple_server analyze-login \
  --pcap /path/to/reference.pcapng \
  --tcp-stream 83 \
  --packets \
  --fail-on-invalid
```

`--packets` appends one frame-aligned structured record with direction, timing,
wire offsets, opcode, shape coverage, and decoded fields. `--json` exposes the
same packet records as machine-readable objects. The analyzer reports full,
partial, unknown, and invalid interpretations.
Account success, world records/sentinel, world/channel/character selections,
the two-stage opcode-`402` transition, and handoff are fully validated. The
character-list envelope is deliberately partial until its inner records are
decoded. Opcode-`13` acknowledgments and client status messages are fully
decoded; length-prefixed type-`6`/type-`7` security bodies are structurally
bounded and intentionally reported as opaque.

Inspect a transcript without dumping its entire payload:

```sh
python -m maple_server inspect captures/session.jsonl
```

Compare two sessions without printing their potentially sensitive payloads:

```sh
python -m maple_server compare captures/session-one.jsonl captures/session-two.jsonl
```

Transcripts are JSONL files created with mode `0600`. Every data record has a
nanosecond timestamp, direction, and base64 payload. Credentials are read from
environment variables and are never stored in a transcript.

## Keep MapleStory audio muted

The included user service discovers PipeWire output nodes by stable
application identity (`Maplestory_Classic.exe`) rather than a changing numeric
node ID:

```sh
systemctl --user link \
  /home/sdancer/ms/tools/maplestory_classic_server/maplestory-audio-mute.service
systemctl --user enable --now maplestory-audio-mute.service
systemctl --user status maplestory-audio-mute.service
```

It checks every 250 ms and mutes newly created/recreated MapleStory streams
without affecting other applications.

## Current implementation steps

1. Run the replay listener inside the client's network namespace; host-only
   listeners do not receive namespace-local port redirects.
2. Validate the successful login reference before sourcing any replay frames.
3. Acknowledge native client opcode `13`, then return the validated account,
   world records, and world-list sentinel as one reactive sequence.
4. Return server opcode `402` frames for client opcode `4` with delays
   `0,2.5`, and use `--rewrite-channel-transition-world`; the client otherwise
   stalls before emitting channel opcode `5` when the captured world differs.
5. Return the partially decoded character list, server time, and type-`7`
   security request for opcode `5`; the client must complete its type-`6`
   response sequence and emit character opcode `7` before handoff.
6. Rewrite the validated opcode-`5` handoff to the local stream-`92` replay
   listener only after opcode `7`. Sending it proactively blanks the scene but
   does not open a world connection.
7. Finish the inner character-list and initial world/map packet models.
